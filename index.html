<b>Summary:</b>
<br />
Kamui is a samurai warrior and the current <i>hatamoto</i> (旗本 — literally "Guardian of the Banner") in direct service to the <i>Shōgun</i> of Land of Iron. After his country was fractured by a bloody civil war, Kamui came down from his solitary perch in the mountains, quelled the fighting, and managed to unite the four warring factions under one banner. He serves as one of the country's top military generals and works to rebuild the nation, foster cooperation, and promote peace both within his jurisdiction and throughout the region.

<b>Physical Description:</b>
<br />
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/YqTnBWVZ/Kamui-Bust-Bio.png"</img>
As a veteran swordsman, Kamui exudes a quiet intensity through his rugged attire and his austere countenance. He is a tall, muscular man with a sculpted chest, broad shoulders, sinewy limbs, washboard abs, and a narrow waist. His hair is long and jet black, which he usually keeps tied in a traditional samurai top knot. However, his most notable feature by far is his cold, empty eyes—a ghostly, ethereal white glare that is both fearsome and piercing. Clad in traditional oriental garb, he wears a gray, short-sleeved <i>gi</i> and <i>hakama</i> trousers tucked into his knee-high dark leather boots, as well as dark leather bracers to guard his arms. Draped over his shoulders, he wears a white <i>haori</i> with the kanji <i>Katana</i> (刀 — literally "Sword") emblazoned on the back; it is his badge of office as the <i>Kenshin</i>.

<b>Personality:</b>
<br />
Wise beyond his years, Kamui is, for all intents and purposes, an old soul lodging in a young body, driven by the ideals and principles of sages past while living in a modern world where his archaic motivations are generally misunderstood. Despite his young age, he exhibits the philosophical inclinations and leadership qualities of a true master, stunning even his teachers and elders. He seeks beauty and balance in everything he does and encounters, always striving to reach the pinnacle of existence—the ultimate state of perfection—through the art of swordsmanship. By following this noble and honorable path, he believes, he will become not only a better warrior but also a better person: a strong, selfless man capable of kindness, patience, and sacrifice. His unyielding devotion to this path of self-realization, however, leaves him withdrawn from all things pedestrian and mundane. Detached and unconcerned, the stern, stoic, solitary Kamui treats most things with an air of indifference that borders on arrogance. At least, that's how other people see it. In reality, he is just a rather quiet and pensive person, preferring the realm of his own intricate thoughts over a trivial verbal exchange. Likewise, he prefers meditation and solitude over the company of others. Idle chatter and small talk are a nuisance to him, and he actively avoids these fruitless gestures, to the point of walking away from the conversation altogether, should it become tedious or uninteresting. For the most part, Kamui is reserved and apathetic. He pays little heed to mundane affairs and stays out of arguments if he can help it, considering them stupid and pointless. Naturally, he quickly dismisses those he deems unworthy of his time, dismissing their pleas and whines with a wave of the hand. Bearing such an adamant disposition, Kamui simply cannot be bothered with unimportant matters. His speech reflects this overbearing, presumptuous attitude. He speaks calmly, lowly, politely, never resorting to crude words or blatant confrontation. In spite of the most vicious provocation, Kamui retains his unflinching composure, responding only with a snide or sarcastic remark, if he even bothers to respond at all. But despite his serene and casual style, he is incredibly blunt and very matter-of-fact, always presenting the truth as it is, no holds barred—people's feelings be damned. He's not above using intimidation and scare tactics either, to keep silence annoying idiots or keep his subordinates in line. He carries himself with an unyielding air of confidence that tends to unsettle those around him. In combat, his menacing presence and his imposing, powerful frame alone are enough to unnerve his foes before the fight even begins.  Furthermore, Kamui also has a dark side borne of his bloody clan's lineage, ripe with twisted thoughts and sadistic intentions. Although this aspect of him rarely emerges, he does derive amusement from it when it scarcely does, especially during a brutal beat-down. He openly revels in the pain of his enemies and enjoys watching them suffer. For this reason, he'll often drag out the final killing stroke for his own wicked pleasure, torturing his fallen foes until they beg him for death—and even then, they may not be so lucky.

<b>Moral Alignment:</b> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Lawful Neutral</span></b>
<br />
Kamui acts as his personal code directs him, even if it goes against the established system of law. Order, structure, and organization are paramount to him, but he does not seek to impose these on anyone besides himself. Essentially, he is honorable and reliable without being a zealot for any given cause, creed, or flag. In accordance with his way of the warrior, Kamui will always abide by his oaths and promises, and he will never betray his allies. He will never lie. He will never shed the blood of unarmed innocents.

Kamui gained nationwide recognition in the Land of Iron after he single-handedly put an end to the bloody civil war that had ravaged the country for over a decade. Through tactful diplomacy and compelling displays of force, he subdued the four feuding factions and brought them under his control. Whether they respected him, feared him, or were simply powerless to challenge him, they all swore unconditional fealty to Kamui and thus named him the <i>Shizoku Shukun</i> (四族主君 — literally "Lord of the Four Clans"). To the people, he became known as the <i>Idai Chōtei-Sha</i> (偉大調停者 — literally "Great Unifier"), for uniting the four clans under one banner and ushering in a new era of peace. The samurai, in particular, believe he is the <i>Tenken</i> (天剣 — literally "Heavenly Sword"), a mythical figure that is said to descend from heaven to guide the Land of Iron to an age of propserity. As one of the country's most prominent leadership figures, he drove what eventually became known as the <i>Goisshin</i> (御一新 — literally "Honorable Restoration"), which began a cultural shift back to tradition and the ways of old. It is predominantly defined by the reestablishment of a strong, centralized, military feudal government. Essentially, the shogunate was reinstated, in order to prevent the suffering and bloodshed of recent memory from ever happening again. Abroad, however, Kamui is viewed in a very different light. Instead of a peacekepper, he is seen as a symbol of strength and military might. He is widely regarded as one of the strongest samurai to ever arise from the Land of Iron. As powerful as he is ruthless, he is known for his unrivaled swordsmanship and his overwhelming presence on the battlefield. Even the most battle-oriented ninja are wary of needless (and especially impulsive) confrontation with him, acknowledging his tremendous skill as both warrior and general. In particular, Kamui is tasked with protecting the Land of Iron from the festering lawlessness in the northern mountains, fending off bandit raids and pushing back against the impending tide of chaos that threatens his country.  For these impressive military feats, the Shōgun named him <i>Kita Taishō</i> (北大将 — literally "Northern General").

<br />
Silverfrost Mountain is the highest mountain in the Land of Iron; it lies to the north of the country, in the frigid, desolate badlands, where the shogunate's influence does not extend. Plagued by blistering cold and daunting snowfall, it is considered a mystical, holy place, far detached from the toils and troubles of the world below. As such, it is a target destination site of many pilgrimages and warrior trials. But because of the hazardous weather conditions and the very real threat of hypothermia, it is rarely frequented by common folk and proves rather difficult for armies to traverse, making it a very quiet and secluded area. Superstitious bandits and cutthroats tend to steer clear of it, fearing the divine punishment of the <i>kamui</i> for daring to tread on sacred ground. It is primarily known for the small, reclusive communities of ascetic hermits and holy men. One of these groups is known as the <i>Yamabushi</i> (山武士 — literally "Mountain Warriors"), the very ones who trained and forged Kamui into the warrior he is  today. Although he currently resides in the imperial city, the capital of Land of Iron, Silverfrost Mountain will always be Kamui's spiritual home.

<br />
<b>Education:</b> <i>Ginsōyama</i> (銀霜山 — literally "Silverfrost Mountain")
<br />
On Silverfrost Mountain, Kamui received a well-rounded, universal education from the asectic hermits that raised him. He was taught to read and write, and he was instructed in a broad array of subjects, including literature, physical sciences, philosophy, and economics. To complement these scholarly pursuits, the <i>Yamabushi</i> trained him in the art of combat and survival. Having adopted a cross-teaching with samurai weaponry and <i>ninshū's</i> spiritual approach to power, they taught Kamui not only how to fight with a sword, but also how to use his chakra to connect with others.

<b>Textual Works:</b> <i>The Tale of a Cowardly Rōnin</i>, <i>The Tragedy of Muramasa</i>, <i>Meadows of Desire</i>
<br />
An excellent and versatile writer, Kamui has authored three best-selling books thus far. The first one, <i>The Tale of a Cowardly Rōnin</i>, is a comedy about the questionable exploits and humorous happenings of a masterless samurai during the Warring States Period. The second, <i>The Tragedy of Muramasa</i>, tells the tragic story of the legendary blacksmith, Muramasa, and his obsession with cursed swords. <i>Meadows of Desire</i>, Kamui's most recent publication, is his first piece of content aimed exclusively at an adult audience. It tells the dramatic tale of a young man and his involvement with three of the most popular prostitutes in his hometown's brothel, as well as his scrapes with the local drug lord who owns them.

<b>Clan:</b> <b><span style = "color:darkred">Mitsurugi Clan</span></b>
<br />
The <b>Mitsurugi Clan</b> (御剣一族 , <i>Mitsurugi Ichizoku</i>) is a violent, bloodthirsty samurai clan which hails from the mountainous northern region of the Land of Iron, where lawlessness and anarchy reign supreme. It is notorious for producing <i>hitokiri</i> (人斬 — literally "man-slayers"), extremely deadly swordsmen bred and trained for a sole purpose: to kill for the highest bidder. Unlike shinobi who carry out assassinations using subtlety and discretion, these ruthless samurai execute their targets in broad daylight, in full view of the public eye, in order to induce as much terror and chaos as possible. Given their infamous reputation, the Mitsurugi pride themselves on being "the strongest samurai clan" (最強侍の一族 , <i>saikyō samurai no ichizoku</i>). Although Kamui descends from this clan, he is not aware of his connection to them.
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/JnLzn84m/Steel-Blue-Divider.png"</img>
<br />
<b>Kekkei Genkai:</b> <b><span style = "color:darkred">Mark of the Manslayer</span></b> (人斬り呪印 , <i>Hitokiri Juin</i>)
<img draggable="false" ondragstart="returnfalse;" src="https://i.postimg.cc/TPWC9PHX/Manslayer-Mark.png"</img>
The Mark of the Manslayer is a cursed seal that appears only in the the most ruthless killers of the Mitsurugi Clan. The legends claim that it is a physical manifestation of the clan's thirst for blood and affinity for assassination and murder, a feeling so deeply engrained that it is passed down from generation to generation. The appearance of the mark varies from user to user, but in Kamui's case, it manifests as two black stripes banding across his cheeks, representing the fangs of a tiger. When activated, the mark drastically enhances the user's physical and mental abilities. Attributes such as strength, speed, stamina, and reflexes are are pushed well beyond their natural limits—to the absolute pinnacle. In addition, the mark also heightens the user's perception, allowing them to see incredibly fast movements in slow motion, and it also sharpens their killer instinct, allowing them to instuitively sense their foes' openings, weaknesses, and vulnerabilities. And finally, perhaps the most notable and terrifying aspect of the mark is that it greatly augments the user's <b><span style = "color:darkred">Killing Intent</span></b> (殺気 , <i>Sakki</i>). Essentially, the mark provides the user with all the necessary tools to become deadliest, most efficient killers they can possibly be. The mark achieves this by gathering natural energy and infusing it into the user's body. Although Kamui possesses this ability, he cannot fully control it. For him, the mark only emerges during stressful or dire situations. Still, even if he could control it, he considers it a despicable and bloodthirsty power and actively rejects its influence.

<br />

<br />
Kamui's signature weapon, the <i>Yamato</i> (大和 — literally "Great Harmony") is a simple yet elegant <i>shirisaya</i> (白鞘 — literally "white scabbard") katana crafted by a master blacksmith in the Land of Swords. Designed for ease of carry and concealability, this katana is mounted on a featureless hilt without traditional wrapping and has no guard or custom fittings; it is a very humble sword that is inconspicuous and unobtrusive. All in all, the sword is not mounted for actual combat use. The sword was forged using the purest <i>tamahagane</i> (玉鋼 — literally "round and precious steel") steel, which gives the blade its bright, silvery color. The construction of the Yamato differs from that of other Japanese swords in the fact that it is made to be thicker and extremely dense by using additional iron ore and repeated folding of the metal. As such, the sword is unusually heavy, making it rather unwieldy for the typical swordsman. However, given these metallurgical properties, the blade is extremely durable, highly resistant to bending and shattering, and is capable of being honed to a sharp, resilient edge that requires little maintenance. Furthermore, the sword's hilt and scabbard were carved from the bark of a special spirit tree from which ancient demon relics and other ritualistic instruments are made. As such, the hilt and scabbard are also extremely durable as well and are capable of repelling chakra-based attacks.

<br />

<br />
A <i>tetsubō</i> (鉄棒 — literally "iron stick") is a traditional two-handed Japanese war club typically employed against armored enemy combatants in the Land of Iron. It quite literally consists of a spiked iron bar with a polygonal cross-section welded onto a thick steel handle wrapped in silk and a metal loop attached to the pommel. First and foremost, it is extremely heavy, weighing in at 3 metric tons (6,600 lbs), making it cumbersome and dangerous to wield, even with two hands. While it can be used as a weapon on the battlefield to deliver crushing attacks with blunt force, its primary use is actually for training and conditioning. Given its immense weight and unwieldy nature, those who train with this hulking piece of iron as if it were a sword will develop incredible core stability, grip strength, and muscular power. Any who is considered strong can lift 3 metric tons and lug it around, but being able to fully control it—that is, to accelerate the weapon to top speed and then stop it at a moment's notice, to recover from a powerful swing without exposing yourself to a counter-attack—requires extraordinary skill, tremendous balance, and solid footwork. Kamui can wield this weapon as easily as if it were a twig, which speaks volumes of his swordsmanship.

<br />

<br />
<i>Tetsugutsu</i> (鉄靴 — literally "iron boots") are a set of weighted boots used for training. Tried and true, simple yet effective, the age-old method has become a staple of samurai training across generations. By increasing the wearer's distal lower weight, these boots promote a pronounced development and extreme hypertrophy of the leg muscles, making the wearer's lower limbs incredibly strong without any dedicated strength training. This allows the wearer to vastly increase their natural speed and agility. In addition, for samurai specifically, it aids in the improvement of footwork, which is an indispensable aspect of swordsmanship. The boots achieve this effect with the unique seal inscribed on the soles. The seal, which reads <i>Ishi</i> (意志 — literally "Will"), functions very much like a self-adapting drop set; it adjusts the resistance of the boots according to the user's remaining strength and stamina. The seal can also be released at will, which will provide a second wind to the wearer as well as tremendously boost their speed and agility. In Kamui's case, at his full strength, the boots weigh approximately 5 metric tons (11,000 lbs) each. Needless to say, they need to handled carefully, because if dropped (without proper deactivation), the boots can produce sizable craters in the ground.

<br />

<br />
A <i>tetsukishō</i> (鉄記章 — literally "iron medallion") is a pendant comprised of a metal disk inscribed with the symbol of the Four Clans of the Land of Iron, which comprise the backbone of the country's military force. Just as academy students are given forehead protectors to wear once they graduate and become genin, apprentice swordsmen are granted the honor to wear one of these medallions once they become full-fledged samurai. As an important part of samurai tradition, wearing one represents pride in one's warrior heritage and fealty to the Shōgun, the leader of Land of Iron. In addition, the medallion also represents the authority of the state. Whosoever wears this medallion has the power vested in them by the Shōgun to enforce law, order, and justice within Land of Iron. Because of this, samurai are widely recognized as protectors of the people and and keepers of the peace; they are impartial arbiters who are often called to settle disputes and mediate conflicts between private citizens and factions alike. In this regard, the medallion symbolizes the samurai's vision of peace and unity.

<b><span style = "color:587ebf">Tokijin</span></b> (闘鬼神 — literally "Fighting Demon God")

<br />
<br />
Tokijin is Kamui's <i>shugoshin</i> (守護神 — literally "guardian deity"), a spectral entity that binds itself to a human host. Unlike other spirits, who seek to gather physical energy to assume a corporeal form, the guardian spirits of Silverfrost Mountain seek a worthy vessel to guide and protect throughout their mortal journey. In return, the spirit is allowed the privilege of wandering the world of the living once more before being cast into the Spiritual Plane (霊的世界 , <i>Reitekisekai</i>). Tokijin's appearance is that of black-skinned humanoid <i>oni</i> (鬼 — literally "demon"), with pointy ears, menacing fangs, two horns, and a third eye on his forehead. He wears the garb of a <i>yamabushi</i> (山武士 — literally "mountain warrior") as well as the <i>nenju</i> (念珠 — literally "prayer beads") of esoteric monks, signifying his status as a holy being. He usually lingers behind Kamui's back, hovering just above his head, and follows his master wherever he goes. Because he is composed largely of spiritual energy, he is visible to very few people. Not even the visual prowess of the Three Great Dōjutsu (i.e. Byakugan, Sharingan, Rin'negan) is able to perceive him. Only those who are spiritually attuned may glimpse at Tokijin. And even then, he may only appear as a blurry or dark, murky, translucent silhouette. To see him fully, one must a achieve a profound spiritual connection with Tokijin's host. Like Kamui himself, Tokijin is a master of kenjutsu, wielding dual <i>tsurugi</i> swords as his primary weapons. Also, using Yin Release, he is able to cut the bonds and links of chakra itself, an ability Tokijin calls <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Shinbatsu</span></b> (神罰 — literally "Divine Punishment") but is more commonly known as <b>Chakra Sever</b> (チャクラ断, "<i>Chakuradan</i>"). In terms of character, Tokijin's personality is highly reminiscent of his master's, except he is notably far more wrathful and temperamental, preferring to dish out retribution where Kamui would offer mercy. Unlike Kamui, who is primarily dedicated to balance, Tokijin's inclination is to destroy evil without question. He professes a fierce sense of justice that he often takes to the extreme.

<br />
Although he has been long estranged from his ancestral origins, Kamui remains, to this day, a true heir of the Mitsurugi Clan—a vile, bloodthirsty clan of ill repute, but widely recognized as the strongest samurai clan. Thus, with Mitsurugi blood flowing strongly through his veins, he inherited their extraordinarily powerful chakra and a massive chakra pool—one that rivals that of the Five Kage. With reserves of this lofty caliber, Kamui can cast multiple chakra-taxing techniques in rapid succession and still have enough in the tank to continue fighting indefinitely. By merely flexing his chakra, he can exert tremendous force within his area of effect, causing the air to grow thick and heavy, causing the very earth to crack and split, weighing down whoever or whatever dares to approach. The sheer magnitude of pressure also generates a fierce surge of razor-sharp winds that swirl around him, inflicting paper-thin cuts and slicing fabric with ease. Strong enough to splinter wood and crush stone into dust, the pressure is incredibly daunting to those who cannot withstand it. Sensors often describe his chakra as having a sharp, focused edge, not unlike the steel of a blade, quietly resting within its sheath, just waiting to be unleashed. Those who can see it claim it is a cold, pale blue.
<br />
<b>Chakra Control:</b> <a  href="https://i.gyazo.com/756b3a15b29f17d17276bfbf68963990.png">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Remarkable</span></b>
<br />
Ever since a young age, Kamui excelled at all forms of chakra manipulation and is even able to maintain multiple techniques at once. With this innate talent, he can effortlessly gather chakra from any part of his body with such precision and perform his techniques to their maximum potential without any wasted energy or timing. This allows him to execute his techniques quickly and efficiently, all while conserving his chakra to the highest extent. Using his refined chakra control, he can mold chakra and adapt it to a specific person’s chakra signature in order to transfer it to them. He can even suppress his chakra to the point where it is undetectable by enemy sensor types, by perfectly blending it with that of the surrounding environment. By applying the teachings of <i>ninshū</i>, Kamui can share his chakra with others and connect his spiritual energy with theirs in order to gain a more profound understanding of their hearts and motivations. This allows him to communicate with complete strangers on a level that transcends the physical, without the need for words or gestures, and allows him to pray for their safety and even accompany them in spirit once they part ways.
<br />
<b>Life Force:</b> <a  href="https://cutt.ly/EtT2yy">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Powerful</span></b>
<br />
As a descendant of the Mitsurugi Clan, Kamui boasts a particularly robust and potent life force. According to the Mitsurugi, exceptionally powerful swordsmen, driven by intense feelings of anguish and aggression, can pass on pieces of their life force to their offspring, a phenomenon which they claim is the reason why not all clan members are capable of awakening their bloodline limit. In this way, the ruthless and bloodthirsty <i>hitokiri</i> can ensure the transmission of their energy and vitality to the next generation. The phenomenon is so deeply engrained in both their culture and spirituality that it is believed that they can even pass on visions and memories of their most gruesome experiences. And these things, when viewed, can greatly augment the inheritor's life force. Given how strong Kamui's life force is, his parents must have surely been one of these legendary killers, who wielded swords stained with the blood of hundreds—if not thousands—of victims. As a result, his heritage imbues him with tremendous physical strength and durability. It even confers onto him an unnatural degree longevity, which slows his aging and extends his lifespan beyond what is normally possible.
<br />
<b>Willpower:</b> <a  href="https://i.gyazo.com/9d126148af2a7736482bc8883d46a891.png">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Indomitable</span></b>
<br />
Having unnaturally strong willpower, which he tempered through meditation and grueling trials, Kamui’s spirit is damned near impossible to break. He is extremely resilient to excruciating pain, emotional distress, psychological torture, and brainwashing tactics. Also, because his psychic resistance is directly linked to his strength of will, Kamui can ward off hypnosis and withstand telekinetic attacks through the sheer force of his <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Iron Will</span></b> (鉄意志 , <i>Tetsu Ishi</i>). Every time Kamui has been seemingly defeated, every time he is left battered and broken, he manages to rise back onto his feet and continue the fight, displaying unbelievable toughness and unbreakable determination. This unnatural drive to defy fate is arguably Kamui’s strongest power. He is the kind of man to die standing on his feet, mocking the arrival of death itself.
<br />
<b>Intent:</b> <a  href="https://i.gyazo.com/9d126148af2a7736482bc8883d46a891.png">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:darkred">Indomitable</span></b>
<br />
Having inherited the <b><span style = "color:darkred">Mark of the Manslayer</span></b>, Kamui wields an overwhelming <i>Sakki</i> (殺気 — literally "Killing Intent") to a startling degree, even when the mark lies dormant. It is the ability to exude pure killing intention and having it affect one's opponent, themselves, and others around them, up to the point of paralyzing them with fear. Kamui’s bloodlust is particularly strong, so when he exerts his chakra, lesser warriors may experience tightness in their chest, nausea, cold sweats, panic, and anxiety; they may even hallucinate visions of their own gruesome death. As a veteran swordsman with no shortage of combat encounters, Kamui has learned to weaponize those intense and dreadful feelings of angst and trepidation against his enemies. For one, he is in complete control of his bloodlust, able to completely suppress it or amplify it to outrageous levels. Normally, uncontrolled spikes of bloodlust can give away an incoming attack, as the target can sense these feelings of aggression and violence. However, when bloodlust is applied constantly and uniformly across an area, it forms a thick fog of sorts that masks the user’s battle spirit, making them less susceptible to prediction and foresight abilities. It also dampens—or outright hinders—chakra sensing, further limiting their overall awareness. Essentially, this curtain of bloodlust induces a very pernicious effect that dulls and blurs the foe's metaphysical perception by influencing them at a subconscious level.

<br />
Like many other warriors, Kamui can utilize both Yin and Yang Release to control his spiritual and physical energy, respectively. These two nature transformations comprise the foundation of his chakra-based abilities, which are heavily rooted in shape transformation. Besides that, however (and perhaps most notably), Kamui was born with a unique nature transformation kekkei genkai known as <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Swift Release<span></b> (迅遁, <i>Jinton</i>), which he expertly uses to move and attack with incredible speed, becoming nigh-invisible even to eyes blessed with visual prowess. With his extreme physical conditioning and already immense natural speed, coupled with techniques such as <i>Iaidō</i> (居合道 — literally "Way of Quick-Drawing"), Kamui can boost his movement and striking speed to an entirely unprecedented level using Swift Release, a level which rivals the usage of space-time techniques. When all of the above are combined, Kamui becomes a truly terrifying speedster, able to outrun lightning from the heavens itself.

<br />
Even in the early stages of his life, Kamui displayed an innate sensivity to chakra. Without being told or realizing where he was, he could sense the mystical air and the mysterious nature of the chakra that permeated his ancestral home, Silverfrost Mountain. And somehow, he always seemed able to get a faint reading on people's character, determining whether their intentions are inherently good or bad. Of course, this talent had to be refined through rigorous training. But in the end, Kamui became an exceptionally skilled sensor. Now, he can detect his targets from considerable distances by sensing their chakra. He is even able to discern when other combatants are using specific techniques and determine their chakra nature, their clan’s identity, and the capacity of their bloodline limit—if he has encountered them before. Using this sense, he can pick a person out from a crowd by scanning for the specific chakra signature in question. For tracking, he can place his finger on the ground and intuitively feel the exact size of an enemy group, their formation (if any), and the direction in which they are moving as well as their speed of travel. By applying the teachings of <i>ninshū</i>, Kamui developed a unique sensing technique which he calls <i>Senrigan</i> (千里眼 - literally "Clairvoyance"). By quieting the storm within his own mind, Kamui can hone in on the spiritual energy of others. This allows him to perceive their presence even if they are actively suppressing their chakra, because no matter how hard they try, they cannot stifle their soul.
<br />
<b>Intelligence:</b> <a  href="https://i.gyazo.com/b8fb5ee67dcc2afe8927b275f47d46ae.png">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Genius<span></b>
<br />
With an IQ of over 200, Kamui possesses a genius-level intellect in his own right. However, instead of relying solely on his ability to adapt and process information quickly (like the typical lazy genius), he became an active learner and student of martial arts and warfare, incensed by a profound curisosity and a deep desire to expand his knowledge. Recognizing that his options in combat are limited to his proficiency in swordsmanship, Kamui saw the urgent need to learn how to formulate effective strategies, employ proper preparation, and perfect his real-time tactics. Now, having studied the tomes and philosophies of brilliant generals and having fought in countless samurai battles, Kamui is a battle-hardened warrior with over a decade of live combat experience in various aspects of warfare. Throughout the course of his academic preparation, Kamui gathered encyclopedic knowledge of a multitude of battle tactics, shinobi combat skills, bloodline limits, and fighting styles. Thus, he is quickly able to deduce his opponent’s mode of attack and spot and detect their flaws and limitations, no matter how obscure their methods may be. This allows him to successfully counter his opponent’s attacks and even turn their strengths into liabilities. Every time Kamui enters a hostile situation where he expects even a nasty argument, he has already analyzed the environment for defensive positions, possible escape routes, and likely threats, and he has already devised a plan to neutralize everyone in the room. This is why Kamui is widely considered a strategic genius. He can apply these skills to any and all objectives, especially when standing at the helm of an army, able to formulate strategies and plans several steps ahead of his opponent. He can anticipate most (if not all) of the possible obstacles that may arise and knows the best actions to take in any situation, allowing him to adapt and prepare for future events well in advance.

<b>Hand Seal Knowledge:</b> <a  href="https://embed.gyazo.com/6b631821beb15dbcadd989a96068963a.png">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Basic<span></b>
<br />
Raised as a samurai, and not as a shinobi, Kamui never underwent any formal training in ninjutsu. As such, he is unlearned in the usage of hand seals; the very concept is completely foreign to him. This is because, as a samurai, he has no need for them, as kenjutsu techniques do not require hand seals. He knows there are 12 hand seals, and he knows which one is which, but beyond that, he knows very little of how they're used to perform techniques. So if he witnesses a sequence of hand seals, he will not be able to discern what kind of technique it is based solely on the hand seals formed.
<br />
<b>Speed Level:</b> <a  href="https://cutt.ly/etT9Rm">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Astonishing<span></b>
<br />
Supremely quick, nimble, and agile, Kamui is a master of high-speed movement, capable of accelerating and maneuvering with utmost control and precision. and He attained his incredible speed through his swordsmanship training, using the age-old method of practicing with a much heavier weapon to drastically heighten his physical conditioning and bodily movements. After a decade of such arduous training, Kamui had acquired a speed beyond imagining. He is so unbelievably fast that he can appear to be in several places at once as he fights multiple foes scattered throughout a battlefield. Those who claim to be able to follow his movements are often viewing nothing more than a series of afterimages he leaves throughout the trajectory of his path. Essentially, they're seeing Kamui in retrospect, because he is usually long gone after the fact. He appears, strikes, and vanishes before his foes even realize what happened. Other experienced speedsters have likened his speed to a form of teleportation; he can effortlessly blur in and out of sight. This is because his body does not flicker or flash when he moves. Instead, it just disappears, instantaneously. One moment he is standing there, and the next, he simply isn’t. Likewise, his reflexes are considered top-tier—god-like even. He can react to split-second events that other people would not notice until it was too late. Sometimes, he moves so fast that, through his eyes, his enemies appear to be moving in slow motion. Through his mastery of <i>battōjutsu</i> (抜刀術 — literally "blade drawing technique"), he can intercept shinobi before they even have a chance to form handseals. In addition, he is extremely proficient in the <i>Shukuchi</i> (縮地 — literally “Reduced Earth”) method, the samurai equivalent of the shinobi's <i>Shunshin no Jutsu</i> (瞬身の術 — literally "Body Flicker Technique"), using it to cross considerably vast distances in a mere instant. And he is so expertly conditioned in its usage that he can perform hundreds of steps in rapid succession without tiring. He owes this tremendous speed to his physical conditioning which he attained using the iron boots training method for more than a decade. Subjecting the body to this level of stress on a daily basis forces it to adapt well beyond its natural limits, which induces an unprecedented increase in strength and power in order to overcome this resistance.
<br />
<b>Physical Strength:</b> <a  href="https://cutt.ly/stT3si">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Mammoth<span></b>
<br />
Although he lacks the typical brawn and burliness that is associated with great physical strength, Kamui is actually quite strong, deceivingly enough. He could probably lift boulders and unearth trees if he really tried, but his strength is more apparent through his practice of swordsmanship. As previously mentioned, by training with a weapon that weighs far more than he does—and learning to control that weight—Kamui developed a solid foundation for building immense physical strength, as well as incredible core stability, insane grip strength, and overwhelming muscular power. The sheer force behind his swings can produce vacuum columns and release waves of highly pressurized wind that can cut through steel—all without using chakra. By striking down on his opponents from above, he can produce earth-shattering quakes and form massive craters in the ground. The fact that he is able to lift his <i>tetsubō</i> with a single hand and wield it as flawlessly as he does serves as a testament to his impressive strength.
<br />
<b>Durability:</b> <a  href="https://embed.gyazo.com/d997cc349d02522e2088bc4960360151.png">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Immense<span></b>
<br />
With such a strong and well-developed physique, Kamui boasts extreme durability and physical resilience. Due to his intense training regimen, his muscles and bones are much harder and denser than a normal person’s, which makes his bodily integrity and composition much more resistant to damage of all kinds. Even when not empowered by his chakra, he can withstand crushing blows and severe injuries that would easily cripple an ordinary human being.
<br />
<b>Stamina Level:</b> <a  href="https://i.gyazo.com/84922de9ba81c6e417e3e7511bc70889.png">➜</a> <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Dominant<span></b>
<br />
Trained to physical and mental peak, Kamui feels right at home amidst the frantic screams and painful wails common to any battlefield. As a samurai from a war-torn region, he has become desensitized to the sight of blood and the agonizing cries of dying men. Highly resistant to the debilitating effects of prolonged stress and tension, he dominates the battlefield with his impressive stamina. In short, nothing seems to faze him. This is largely the result of being able to keep calm and clear mind, which he cultivated through meditation and rigorous training. He can engage in strenuous physical activities for extended periods of time without succumbing to exhaustion. If need be, he can fight for days on end, forgoing the need for food and rest altogether. In short, when Kamui steps into the fray of war, he becomes a living, breathing weapon, and he doesn't stop until the mission is finished.

<br />
Largely influenced by his powerful life force, Kamui's rate of recovery is simply astounding. His body requires only a few days to recover from even the most critical injuries and severe illnesses. In the midst battle, his wounds close much faster than one would normally expect, preventing excess blood loss. He is also highly resistant to the effects of poisons and other toxic substances and can heal from their imparing effects much more quickly than the average human.

<br />
<br />
Born and raised as a samurai warrior, Kamui has vowed to live and die by the sword, signifying his undying devotion to the art of <i>kenjutsu</i> (剣術 — literally "sword techniques"). This commitment is so deeply rooted in his spirit and so fastly held in his mind that <i>kenjutsu</i> will always be Kamui's one and only combat ability, a martial skill he has arduously cultivated since his childhood days. As such, he professes a profound and unparalleled mastery of swordsmanship. Trained by the <i>yamabushi</i> of Silverfrost Mountain, Kamui received a formal and rigorous instruction in the ways of the sword, specifically in the ancient and powerful style of <i>Taikyokushin-Ryū</i> (太極神流 — literally "Supreme Ultimate God Style"). Invented during the Warriing States period by the strongest swordsman in the land, this style was designed to allow a single samurai to defeat numerous foes single-handedly in pre-village era skirmishes. The style itself is greatly coveted by samurai, because, throughout the history of the Land of Iron, practitioners of this style have accomplished incredible feats of strength and conquest and are highly revered as <i>Kensei</i> (剣聖 — literally "Sword Saints"), bringing great honor to their respective clans. As a masterful practitioner of this style, Kamui boasts unbelievable skill in swordsmanship—skill that is often considered to be outlandishly frightening or unnatural, skill that transcends physical boundaries and limitations. His skill with a sword is so great, in fact, that his <i>ma'ai</i> (間合い — literally "interval"), the extent of his reach with his drawn sword, erects a zone of resounding danger and throbbing dread—an impenetrable field of absolute dominance that deters all but the most seasoned and battle-oriented warriors from approaching. And even for these veterans, heedlessly or recklessly crossing into this area of effect would surely mean instantaneous defeat. To exert such daunting influence on one's opponents by simply drawing a sword is considered the pinnacle of <i>kenjutsu</i>, as it reflects the strength and resilience of the user's battle spirit. Needless to say, it is not an ability that can simply be taught. This, combined with his graceful footwork, his natural strength, and his innate ability to focus, makes him one of best—if not <i>the</i> best—swordsman in the world. Without even drawing his sword, Kamui has repeatedly demonstrated masterful proficiency in <i>nōtōjutsu</i> (納刀術 — literally "sheathed blade techniques"). To defeat most opponents, Kamui doesn't even need to unsheathe his blade, as he can adequately defend himself as well as deliver devastating attacks using nothing more than the hilt and scabbared of his sheathed sword. These blunt strikes are so destructive that they can cause the ground to quake and shatter and even produce sonic booms that can stun opponents. Should the battle escalate, however, and Kamui's hand is forced to draw his blade, it becomes an entirely different ball game. By actually wielding a live blade, Kamui's destructive potential is vastly increased. First and foremost, the speed of his draws is terrifying. Using <i>Iaidō</i> (居合道 — literally "Way of Quick-Drawing"), he can close tremendous gaps and intercept shinobi before they even have the chance to form hand seals; he is capable of attacking first within that very small window of opportunity, and if he realizes that he cannot, he can immediately cancel his attack and withdraw. This is possible because this aspect of <i>kenjutsu</i> emphasizes being aware and capable of quickly drawing the sword, responding to sudden attacks, and anticipating possible moves and maneuvers immediately afterward. He can slice through sturdy opponents and large beasts without staining his blade with blood, which is commonly regarded as the mark of a true swordsman. His precision and control are also noteworthy. For example, he can cut off a lit candle’s wick and hold it on the tip of his blade without extinguishing the flame, and he can split an incoming arrow perfectly in half from tip to nock with his blade. The strength behind his slashes is equally impressive, as he can cut through earth, stone, and steel as easily as he would cut through stalks of wheat in a field. In the face of Kamui's swordsmanship, it’s all the same. By channeling chakra into his blade, Kamui can increase his sword's cutting power and range and even swing his sword to shoot crescent-shaped waves of pure energy to slice opponents from a distance. He can also produce groundbreaking, far-reaching shockwaves from his strikes to dissipate enemy attacks before they reach him or to defeat multiple foes in one swoop. His ultimate attacks are powerful enough to raze through entire legions, alter the terrain with widespread damage, and even rend space-time itself.

Invented by a prominent sect of ancient <i>ninshū</i>-bound samurai, the <i>Taikyokushin-Ryū</i> is a legendary style of <i>kenjutsu</i> that was developed to allow a single samurai to defend their small, peaceful settlements of <i>ninshū</i> followers from raids of bandits and thieves. Originally designed to be a measured and defensive <i>katsujinken</i> (活人拳 — literally "sword that gives life") that would be used to protect people, over time, the style was corrupted into an destructive and aggressive <i>satsujinken</i> (殺人拳 — "sword that kills"), intended to kill and conquer—very much the same way <i>ninshū</i> was eventually corrupted into <i>ninjutsu</i>. Rooted in the concept of <i>ichi no tachi</i>, (一の太刀 — literally "to strike in a single blow") practitioners of this style use a combination of immense speed and agility, quick <i>Iaidō</i> strikes,  and enhanced sensory perception to anticipate an opponent's movements and disable them with single, decisive attack. Because of its purpose to fend off multiple opponents at once, the style stresses efficiency, spareness of exertion, and conservation of energy. This means the style employs powerful yet coordinated movements to easily fell threats, especially in long, drawn-out warfare-scale encounters. Needless to say, the style has withstood the test of time and is considered one of the strongest sword disciplines in the world. Despite its notoriety, however, very few practitioners remain in existence. This is because the style is inextricably linked to <i>ninshū</i>, which is, in and of itself, a dying religion.

<i>Yanagi Yoke</i> (柳避 — literally “Willow Dodge”)
<br />
This advanced high-speed evasion technique is the samurai equivalent of the shinobi's <i>Kawarimi no Jutsu</i> (変わり身の術 — literally "Body Replacement Technique"). It allows the samurai to instantaneously dodge attacks at the very last moment. Instead of replacing themselves with a block of wood or something similar, the user simply remains in place. The movement is so fast that the user appears to not have even moved. From an outside observer’s perspective, the attack goes right through the user.

<i>Shukuchi</i> (縮地 — literally "Reduced Earth")
<br />
The Shukuchi is the samurai equivalent of the shinobi's <i>Shunshin no Jutsu</i> (瞬身の術 — literally "Body Flicker Technique"), which allows the samurai to cover vast distances in an instant. Using it, a samurai can accelerate from rest to maximum speed within the fraction of a second, even while wearing heavy armor. They become invisible to the naked eye; the only thing that can be seen is the result of their footsteps crashing into the ground, a trail which always lags behind their actual position. Although it does use chakra to vitalize the body for rapid movement, the secret of this technique lies in the user's powerful yet controlled footwork, which takes nearly a decade of swordsmanship training to perfect. As such, it cannot be easily copied and requires proper instruction in its unique mechanics to successfully master it. That said, there are lower-level versions of the technique denoted by the number of "steps" they are below the actual technique. For example, the novice form of the technique is called "Three Steps Below <i>Shukuchi</i>". The intermediate and advanced forms are called "Two Steps Below" and "One Step Below", respectively, indicating the difference in speed from the actual technique, which is known simply as <i?Shukuchi</i>. Expert users can effortlessly shift between the different forms, combining slower and faster movements to create after-images or to deliberately lower their speed to match their opponents' specific level of speed.

<b>Unique Traits:</b>
<br />
• <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Heart of the Sword<span></b>: This is Kamui's <i>budo</i> (武道 — literally "warrior way").  It's the personal belief that a sword reflects the heart of its wielder. In more concrete terms, one's actions define their character. That is why Kamui will never draw his sword in anger or for the sake of vengeance. He strongly believes that the sword is not a weapon—it's not an instrument of violence. Instead, the sword is a vehicle for truth, and in the right hands—strong, capable hands—it can be used to uphold justice and promote righteousness across the land. Essentially, the sword is the soul. So by honing one's skills with a blade, one can also hone their spirit into its purest form. This is the creed Kamui lives by.
<br />
• <b><span style = "color:587ebf">Iron Will<span></b>: This is the Land of Iron's <i>Tetsudamashī</i> (鉄魂 — literally "Iron Spirit"). It is the brave, daring, and indomitable spirit that all samurai from the Land of Iron carry within them and allows them to overcome seemingly insurmountable obstacles and to defeat seemingly undefeatable foes. It is a deeply spiritual and cultural ideal that all samurai strive to protect and cultivate in their daily lives.
<br />
• <b>Sensory Overload</b>: enhanced vision, audition, olfaction, tactition, and gustation.
<br />
• <b>Acrobat Class</b>: enhanced agility, dexterity, coordination, and balance. It allows the shinobi to perform impressive, death-defying stunts and complex maneuvers to evade attacks and navigate the terrain.
<br />
• <b>Bullet Time</b>: instantaneous reflexes. Rapid movements are perceived in slow motion, allowing ample time for reaction.
<br />
• <b>Anti-Poison</b>: mithridatism. This is the practice of developing immunity to poisons by gradually self-administering non-lethal doses.
<br />
• <b>Implausible Fencing Powers</b>: mastery of swordsmanship, indicated by ridiculously implausible feats such as slicing through bullet fire.
<br />
• <b>The Third Eye</b>: an innate sensitivity to chakra, refined through training and meditation. It allows one to sense, track, and distinguish between different auras and densities of chakra. It provides a certain degree of metaphysical perception.
<br />
• <b>Eldarin Hands</b>: ambidexterity. It is the state of being equally adept in using both the left and right appendages (such as the hands).
<br />
• <b>Lightning Bruiser</b>: the ability to take and give a lot of damage and move quickly. In the triangle of strength, speed, and durability, the Lightning Bruiser does not trade off one advantage for another.
<br />
• <b>Iron Lungs</b>: longer breath for steadier sniper shots. Ha, no, not really. It is the ability to withstand extremely high or low air pressure and high wind friction, not becoming disoriented or deprived of normal breathing capacity. Under normal atmospheric conditions, this translates into the ability to use oxygen far more efficiently, allowing the user to hold their breath for extended periods of time while staying active. This unique trait is developed over many years of training in high-altitude environments such as mountains.
<br />
• <b>Nirvana</b>: the profound peace of mind that is acquired through liberation of the Cycle of Samsara. It is the state of being free from suffering; it is union with the Divine. It is the ultimate realization as a human being. Such calmness and stillness endows the user with clairvoyance, the ability to sense emotions and fluctuations thereof.

<b>Notable Weaknesses:</b>
<br />
Imortality is only a word. All that exists can die. Every living thing has a weapon against which it cannot defend. Kamui is no exception. Apart from the obvious human condition (and all the weaknesses thereof), as a kenjutsu specialist, Kamui's most glaring vulnerability is that he relies heavily on his blades for all things combat-related. Deprive him of his swords, and he will most surely fall. Also, as a predominantly close-range combatant, Kamui has trouble dealing with long-range ninjutsu users, as the burden of distance can easily put him at a disadvantage. Furthermore, as a samurai, Kamui lacks a fundamental understanding of typical shinobi tactics of trickery and misdirection. Unlike ninja combat, a samurai's approach to fighting is far more direct and methodical.
